PV sizing

Deterministic
	Get historical load for 1-3 years.
	Take nearby historical irradiance values for those years. Convert into theoretical production. Use range of PV capacities to determine optimal.

Stochastic
	Get historical load and weather (temperature and irradiance) for 1-3 years.
	Build correlated simulation model for temperature and irradiance.
	Simulate. Then perterb PV capacities across simulations to determine optimal.

Battery sizing
	Get historical load for 1-3 years.
	Use multiple approaches to evaluate the distribution of outage durations, energy needs, and capacity needs
		Brute force of all outage energy needs and capacity needs across a range of durations
		Sample from historical to get a distribution of energy needs and peak demand during outages
		To get a distribution of outage duration, use CAIDI and estimate of longest outage experienced (more data if needed)

BESS optimization
	Use simlulation of PV and loads from the stochastic example and build a battery optimization based on rates. Make very fast so BESS size can be perturbed.
