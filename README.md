Tool for optimizing residential battery sizing using a low energy cost, low compute Bayesian approach that provides an optimal battery size as quickly and efficiently as possible. 
This tool has two main tasks:
- Pull 15-minute load data from NREL's ResStock model (https://resstock.nrel.gov/datasets), use to generate prior distribution of energy needs for different outage lengths
- Use Bayesian approach using limited user input to quickly extrapolate likely optimal battery size
